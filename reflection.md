I worked with Sydney on this project. Before writing or moving any code, we planned out which attributes and methods needed to go where. I think this ended up really helping us conceptualize our goal and approach for the project. Initially our approach was just to move around code and take methods from procedural_resale_shop into computer and oo_resale_shop. We quickly realized that we would need to rewrite a lot more than we had initially thought. Once we took a more object oriented approach, we finally started to make some progress and successfully managed to construct the computer and resale shop objects. This required us to do some outside research and go to TA hours. We had to rework and rewrite most of the methods which was definitely the toughest part. We struggled a lot with understanding what to do with ItemID and how to successfully make a functioning inventory. After trying multiple different rewrites of the methods and constructors, we finally settled on one that worked when we ran it through main. I think we spent a little bit more time than we had liked on this assignment, but in the end it was satisfying to finally have a working program.
